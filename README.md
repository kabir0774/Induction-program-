I missed my first at GNDEC due to some family work and it did not felt good as i was very excited and was really looking forward for my first day of my college life although i heard from my freinds that how fun was there first day and how it started  with blessing from god with path at gurudwara sahib and then refereshments to speeches at the auditorium from respected principal sir DR. Sehijpal Singh with some famous personalities and VIPS who have achived a lot in their lifes and then ending the day by giving the students a tour of the college and hostels
