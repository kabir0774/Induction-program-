# DAY - 2
## August 1,2025
This was the first day of my college life form my side. I was very excited, it started by all of us gathering in the college auditorium i was just looking here and there,there were all new faces everywhere. The session started with DR. Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HOD) reciting the mool mantra and giving us some tips for our academics. 

### Universal Human Values: Understanding the motive of life
 Our first lecture of the day was held by DR. Priya Darshini Mam (phd in electronic engineering) she gave us brief lecture on universal human values she taught us about how the main destination of our life is not to be rich or buy some kind of luxury things it is just to be happy and everything else is just a path to reach that destination.

 ### Buddy4Study scholarship session
 For me this part of the day was really important some real nice guys came from a scholarships platform 'buddy4study' they told us about their new satya sholarship program which helps the finacially weak students by giving them upto 100% of scholarship. They helped us to register on the website and taught us how to apply for the scholarship.

 ### DR. Arvind Dhingra(Director-STEP & Incharge TAC)
 After the scholarship session DR. Arvind sir came on stage to tell us some things about personality development and how it helps in our day to day life. he also enlighted us about all the socities and clubs present in the college for students , for their studies and for their commnication ,talking and dealing life problems skills. He also happen to play us few games for fun . I really enjoyed his session.
